# AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Project

This project simulates the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, with the goal of transforming raw data into actionable insights through professional-quality reports and dashboards. The project covers the full business intelligence workflow, including data preparation, modeling, analysis, visualization, and dashboard design, providing hands-on experience with real-world BI tasks.

The workflow is structured into four key stages:

1. Connecting & Shaping Data:
In this stage, raw datasets from multiple sources are extracted, cleaned, and transformed using Power Query. Key tasks include connecting to databases and web sources, performing table transformations (pivot, unpivot, merge, append), managing data import modes, applying text, numerical, and date/time functions, grouping and aggregating data, and building rolling calendars. QA and profiling tools ensure data accuracy and reliability.

2. Creating a Relational Data Model:
Here, the focus is on building a robust relational data model using best practices in database design. The project incorporates fact and dimension tables, star and snowflake schemas, primary and foreign keys, relationships with correct cardinality, and active/inactive filters. This stage ensures a strong foundation for complex analytics by managing filter context, bi-directional filtering, hierarchies, and structured model layouts.

3. Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:
Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), calculated columns and measures are created to perform advanced analysis. This includes applying row and filter context, iterator functions, conditional logic, text, date/time, and statistical functions, as well as time intelligence patterns. Measures are optimized for clarity, accuracy, and efficiency in reporting.

4. Visualizing Data with Reports:
The final stage transforms the data model into interactive dashboards. Visualizations include KPIs, trend lines, tables, matrices, maps, and custom visuals. Advanced features like slicers, bookmarks, drill-throughs, page navigation, tooltips, and mobile layouts enhance interactivity. AI-powered insights using decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives, and natural language Q&A are incorporated for deeper analysis.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of BI analytics, equipping users with practical skills in data preparation, modeling, DAX, and Power BI visualization. It is designed to replicate professional BI scenarios, making it an excellent portfolio piece for aspiring analysts and data professionals.
